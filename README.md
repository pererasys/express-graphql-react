## Learning Nodejs, GraphQL, Express and MongoDB.

I've been working with and creating Python REST API's for a few months now and finally decided to start learning
something new. Overall, I found working with Node and GraphQL fairly intuitive, however, I may be biased as the 
underlying concepts behind creating servers transfers over from traditional API's. A big selling point for me is that I was able to learn how to use these technologies and write this app within a few days.
