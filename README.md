## Learning Nodejs, GraphQL, Express and MongoDB in 2 days.

I've been working with and creating Python REST API's for a few months now and finally decided to start learning
something new. Overall, I found working with Node and GraphQL fairly intuitive, however, I may be biased as the 
underlying concepts behind creating servers transfers over from traditional API's.

I plan on deploying a live version in the next few days, once I do I'll update this repository with a link. In
the mean time, feel free to look through the source code or run your own instance.
